## Welcome to Asima's GitHub!!

It's a pleasure to give you a reflection about myself. I am fortunate to be a home maker and simulatenously had the opportunity to contribute professionally to the corporate sector and academia to creat impact and outcomes.

I had the pleasure of playing multiple roles such as a Research Associate in the corporate sector and as an Administrative executive in a customer service setup driving educational outcomes for the institute.

From an academia standpoint, I pursued Masters in Business Administration specialising in Finance & Marketing and also have a Masters in Economics focusing on Business Statistics.
